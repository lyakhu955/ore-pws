SUNO v5 — UNIVERSAL META-TAGS & RULES (COPY-PASTE)

IMPORTANT
- I ALWAYS use Suno v5.
- ALL meta-tags and descriptors MUST use square brackets: [ ... ].
- Do NOT use ( ) or { } for tags. Only [ ].
- Keep tags minimal: Structure + 2–4 Key:Value control tags at the top (in the DESCRIPTION/PROMPT, not inside Lyrics).
- Use 1 main Genre (max 2 if fusion) and 1–3 anchor instruments.
- Reinforce only near key moments (e.g., add [Energy: High] right before the Chorus) instead of adding many tags.

0) FIELD SEPARATION (DESCRIPTION vs LYRICS)
A) DESCRIPTION / PROMPT FIELD (recommended place for control tags)
- Put your control meta-tags here (Key:Value), plus any useful production notes.
- Keep it minimal.

B) LYRICS FIELD (NO top control tags)
- In the LYRICS field, do NOT include top-of-song control meta-tags like:
  [Genre: ...], [Mood: ...], [Energy: ...], [Instrument: ...], [Vocal Style: ...], [Language: ...], [Tempo: ...], [Production: ...]
- The LYRICS must contain ONLY:
  1) the song text, and
  2) only the necessary in-song tags that directly affect performance/structure, such as:
     - Structure: [Intro], [Verse 1], [Pre-Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro], [End]
     - Dynamics (sparingly): [Build], [Build-Up], [Drop], [Break], [Breakdown]
     - Vocal/Performance (inside lines where needed): [Male Vocal], [Female Vocal], [Duo], [Spoken], [Talk-singing], [Whisper], [Harmonies], [Back vocals], [Choir], [Ad-libs]
     - SFX/Ambience (rare): [Rain], [Vinyl crackle], [Crowd cheering], [Applause], [Static], [Silence], [City noise]
